29.12.

(1) throw away transactions that are called and serviced under a minute (bad data from someone that got more then one number on accident)
    -> 30min dev + 30min testing
(2) throw away transactions that are older than X hours and not called or serviced
    -> implemented a separate job, 2h dev + testing
(3) on the raw data that we have been using for the signage adaptor, a data will give us theield "called by" has been added
    this data we need to understand transaction times for each employee
	-> added employee handling to data collection and raw data backup ("called by" and "serviced by")
	-> added "called by" column to excel (along with "serviced by")
	-> added one depth of hierarchy to analytics
	-> added "Employee" dropdown to "Comparison" user interface, reordered user interface combos
	-> 5h dev + testing
Other
    -> SQL Server setup (30min fix)
	-> correction in the raw file: offset by 2h minus 4m 18s (detecting, implementation, testing 1h)

New
(1) Employee stats: Average service times (Today, This Month, All time)
(2) Excel employee report


* the dashboard should just have another section below "Businesses" that has all of that is called "Employee Transaction Times Avg" and list every employee in order of fastest to slowest
* once you click a specific business it should do the same thing but only show results for that business

* build a website/web application that is very secure but would allow me to essentially allow people to renew their vehicle registration online
  * the users data has to be very secure
  * it would be good if the entry process is implemented as a wizard
  * we don't handle titling
  * we have to include handicap tags
  * "All we have to do is motor vehicle renewals but I see profit in handicap tags as well"
* rebuild my website with some fancy features such a cost estimator - since were in 17 offices and each is unique, it would need to estimate cost by
  1.) amount of offices 
  2.) Length of contract
* My advertising system lets me point the system to a URL link that contains only a file and it will place it on my screens. I want a dashboard where my clients can login and have a folder for each office advertised in; the folder will contain only their ad and have a provide a static URL. This will essentially allow my advertising customers to easily replace their current ads without going through me. For security of my screens though, when a change is made, it should not be made effective until I approve it (just in case, someone breaks our terms)
* integrate Media AdNet

* as for tracking the "called by" is so we can see employee average service times and compare them just like how we can compare the entire offices average wait times
I'm not sure yet. I have very rough ideas and need to polish them. 
But I'll share what I'm thinking so we're on the same page, but I need more information before you put effort in it.
